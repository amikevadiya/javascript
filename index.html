    diffrent between var, let and const    
  </pre>
Certainly! Here are some examples to illustrate the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var`:

Example 1: Using `let`
```javascript
let x = 10;
if (true) {
  let x = 20;
  console.log(x); // Output: 20 (inner scope value)
}
console.log(x); // Output: 10 (outer scope value)
```
In this example, `let` is used to declare the variable `x` both inside and outside the `if` block. The `let` declaration inside the block creates a new variable `x` with a value of 20, which is only accessible within the block. The `let` declaration outside the block refers to a separate variable `x` with a value of 10, which is accessible outside the block.

Example 2: Using `const`
```javascript
const PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14

PI = 3.14159; // Throws an error: Assignment to constant variable.
```
In this example, `const` is used to declare the constant `PI` with a value of 3.14. The value of `PI` cannot be reassigned, so attempting to assign a new value (`3.14159`) to `PI` will result in an error.

Example 3: Using `var`
```javascript
var y = 10;
if (true) {
  var y = 20;
  console.log(y); // Output: 20 (inner scope value)
}
console.log(y); // Output: 20 (outer scope value)
```
In this example, `var` is used to declare the variable `y` both inside and outside the `if` block. The `var` declaration inside the block updates the value of the existing variable `y` in the outer scope to 20. Therefore, both the inner and outer `console.log` statements will output 20.

It's important to note that `let` and `const` were introduced in ES6 to address some of the scoping issues and inconsistencies associated with `var`. They provide more predictable behavior and better block scoping, making them preferable choices in modern JavaScript development.
